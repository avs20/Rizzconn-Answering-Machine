I attended THE LLM conference and while this repo is just a way to implement the ideas presented in the conference. 
I made a QA system which takes the text from the transcripts and returns a coherent answer in a markdown format. 

The RAG uses embdedding + full text search + reranking to get relevant results. 

Each query is recorded for analysis purpose in the sqlite db. Need to implement a analysis ui. 

A lot of work needs to be done based on the conference but it's a start. Some screenshots.
